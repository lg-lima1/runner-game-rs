So...this project is about a runner game app I saw on Intagram other day.

# Description
Basically, the whole game is made round by round. In the first round you get for free a small amount of "people". 
Then you have to between a pair of paths. Every path has kind of a portal that, when you pass through, it applies a math to your amount of people. 
It can be anything between add, subtract, multiply or divide. 
After the portal you will encounter another amount of people, bad ones. 
The amount of bad people you encounter is subtracted from your current amount. 
If, after the encounter, your amount is below 1, you lose. 
If is above, another round starts. 
So the objective is to pass through the portal that helps you not to lose.
